# Community Guidelines

!!! abstract "TL;DR"
    Be kind, inclusive, and respectful. No harassment, hate speech, or trolling will be tolerated. Respect everyone’s privacy and intellectual property. Keep discussions constructive and on-topic. Being a part of the Rigs of Rods community is a privilege, not a right, and members who continually breach these guidelines will find themselves limited or removed from the community, regardless of any contributions they have made.

## Be Respectful and Kind

1. Treat everyone with respect. No derogatory or harmful language, harassment, or personal attacks.
2. Encourage positive interactions. Constructive feedback is great, but make sure it's kind and helpful.
3. Discrimination will not be tolerated. This includes racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or any other forms of hate or bigotry.

## No Begging for Content or Help

1. Don’t repeatedly ask for content or mods. Respect the time and effort creators put into their work. Requests for help or content should be polite and reasonable, but please avoid excessive begging.
    
    A few examples of begging include:

    - Constantly asking, “When will this mod be released?” in multiple channels or threads.
    - Sending private messages to creators asking for early access or custom content.
    - Demanding or pressuring others to create mods, skins, or vehicles for you without offering compensation or collaboration.

2. Be patient. The community is here to help, but answers or content may take time. Remember that everyone is a volunteer.

    A few examples of begging for help include:

    - Posting the same request across multiple channels or threads within a short period of time.
    - Continuously asking for personal troubleshooting assistance without attempting to follow previous advice or read existing documentation.
    - Demanding immediate help or answers, especially from specific community members. 

By avoiding these behaviors, you help maintain a positive atmosphere where creators and helpers feel appreciated for their time and contributions.

## Respect Unwritten Rules and Community Norms

1. Be mindful of community culture. Every community has certain unwritten norms that regular members follow. Pay attention to how conversations typically flow and adapt accordingly.
2. Be a good community member. While some rules aren’t explicitly stated, following common sense and showing basic etiquette goes a long way. Respecting unwritten guidelines ensures that the community remains a welcoming and enjoyable place for everyone.

## Respect Moderators

1. Moderators are here to help. If you have a problem, reach out to them respectfully.
2. Follow their instructions. If you're asked to stop certain behavior or move a discussion elsewhere, please comply. They’re working to keep the community safe and welcoming for everyone.

## Engage Constructively

1. Stay on topic. Stick to project-related discussions, whether it's about mods, development, or gameplay.
2. Provide constructive criticism. If you’re giving feedback, do so in a way that builds others up rather than tears them down.
3. Avoid flaming or inciting drama. Heated discussions are okay, but personal attacks, arguments, and toxic behavior are not.

## Keep our Community Safe

1. No harassment or trolling. Harassment and trolling harm the community and make others feel unwelcome or unsafe. Harassment can take many forms, including targeted abuse, threats, personal attacks, or even subtle behaviors like constantly criticizing or belittling someone. Trolls seek to provoke others for entertainment, often derailing discussions and creating a toxic environment.
2. No hate speech or harmful language. This community does not tolerate racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or any other form of discrimination. This includes slurs, derogatory language, or attempts to dehumanize or marginalize any group based on their identity. Hate speech will result in immediate action from moderators, including warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans.
3. No spamming or unsolicited self-promotion. Spamming disrupts meaningful conversations and can overwhelm others. While we encourage sharing mods, ideas, and contributions, excessive self-promotion or promoting unrelated content can derail discussions.
4. Maintain privacy and personal boundaries. Respect the privacy of others and avoid sharing or soliciting personal information, such as real names, addresses, or other sensitive details, without explicit consent. Even seemingly harmless inquiries about personal details can make others feel uncomfortable or unsafe, so it’s crucial to maintain boundaries. Everyone has a right to privacy, respect that.
5. No graphic or inappropriate content. This community is meant to be safe for all ages, so avoid sharing or discussing inappropriate or explicit content. This includes images, links, or discussions that are violent, graphic, or sexually explicit. Moderators may take immediate action if inappropriate content is shared
6. This space is dedicated to the enjoyment and development of Rigs of Rods. Discussions should focus on topics relevant to the game, modding, or community-related matters. While off-topic conversations are welcome in designated areas, they should not dominate the main channels or forums.

## Inclusivity is Key

1. We are a global community. Rigs of Rods attracts people from all over the world, with different cultural backgrounds, languages, and perspectives. It’s important to be open-minded, respectful, and willing to learn from others. Take into account that what may be common or normal in one region may not be the same elsewhere.
2. All skill levels are welcome. Whether someone is brand new to Rigs of Rods or has been contributing for years, everyone deserves respect and encouragement. Beginners may need more help, so be patient and supportive. Experienced users should offer guidance rather than ridicule.
3. Use inclusive language. Avoid making assumptions about others’ identities, such as their gender, background, or abilities.
4. Recognize diverse perspectives and experiences. People will approach topics and conversations differently based on their own life experiences. This diversity makes our community richer. Respect and listen to other viewpoints, and avoid dismissing someone’s contributions or opinions based on assumptions about their background or identity.
5. Avoid exclusionary behavior. Ensure that no one feels left out or alienated. Cliques, inside jokes, and exclusionary behavior can create an unwelcoming environment. Make an effort to include everyone, whether in-game discussions, mod development, or casual chats.

## Don’t Steal Content or Violate Intellectual Property

1. Respect creators’ work. The Rigs of Rods community thrives on user-generated content like mods, skins, and vehicles. While Rigs of Rods itself is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3), this license does not apply to user-generated content. Creators retain full rights over the content they create, and their work must be respected accordingly.

    A few examples of content theft include:

    - Downloading someone else’s mod, skin, or vehicle and reposting it as your own without permission or credit.
    - Modifying someone else's work and sharing it without the original creator’s consent and proper attribution.
    - Using assets, textures, or models from other games, websites, or creators without following their licensing terms.

2. Always give proper credit. When sharing or using someone else’s work, make sure to give clear credit to the original creator. Even if you’ve made modifications, acknowledge the original author in your post or description.

    Examples of giving proper credit:

    - “This vehicle mod was originally created by [Creator’s Name], and I’ve modified it with their permission.”
    - “Textures used in this mod are from [Creator’s Name], used with a Creative Commons license.”

3. Ask for permission when necessary. If you want to use or modify someone else’s work in any way, always ask for their permission first. Many creators are open to collaboration or sharing, but it’s important to show respect by getting their consent.
4. Follow licensing and terms of use. Some content may come with specific licenses that outline how it can be used or shared (e.g., Creative Commons). Make sure to follow these guidelines strictly.

    Violation of licensing include:

    - Re-uploading content that’s been explicitly licensed for non-commercial or personal use without proper attribution.
    - Distributing or selling mods that were meant to be freely available.

By respecting these guidelines, you’re helping to support a healthy and creative community where everyone’s contributions are valued and protected.

## Enforcement and Sanctions

Moderators are responsible for ensuring that all members adhere to the community standards, and violations will be addressed in a fair and consistent manner.

1. Warning
    - First offenses are typically met with a warning. For minor infractions, a moderator may issue a verbal or written warning, either privately or publicly, depending on the situation.
    - Warnings are an opportunity for learning. The goal is to give members a chance to understand what they’ve done wrong and improve their behavior. Members are encouraged to ask moderators for clarification if they’re unsure about what prompted the warning.
2. Temporary Mutes
    - Mutes on Discord may be used to prevent further disruptive behavior. If a user continues to engage in inappropriate or disruptive behavior after receiving a warning, moderators may temporarily mute or restrict them from posting in channels.
3. Temporary Suspensions
    - More serious infractions may result in temporary suspensions. If a user violates community guidelines in a significant way or continues problematic behavior despite multiple warnings, a temporary suspension (ban) may be applied.
    - Duration of suspension: Temporary suspensions typically range from a few days to a few weeks, depending on the nature of the violation and the user’s history. During this time, the suspended member will be unable to post, engage, or access the community.
    - Re-entry after suspension: Members returning from suspension are expected to adjust their behavior accordingly. Further violations after a suspension can result in a permanent ban.
4. Permanent Bans
    - Serious or repeated offenses may result in a permanent ban. In cases where users engage in severe violations or consistently ignore the guidelines and sanctions, they may be permanently banned from the community. This means they will no longer have access to either the Rigs of Rods forums or Discord server.
    - No tolerance for extreme offenses. There is zero tolerance for certain actions, including threats of harm, hate speech, and the sharing of illegal or harmful material. These will result in an immediate and permanent ban.
5. Content Removal 
    - Inappropriate or harmful content may be removed without warning. If a post, comment, or link violates community guidelines, moderators may remove the content to protect the community.
    - Notification of removal: Moderators will typically inform users why their content was removed and provide a reason. However, in extreme cases (e.g., harmful or offensive content), the content may be removed without prior notification to minimize harm.
6. Appeals Process
    - Members can appeal disciplinary actions.  If you feel that a warning, mute, suspension, or ban was applied unfairly, [you may appeal the decision on our Help Desk](https://helpdesk.rigsofrods.org). You may not contact any moderator to appeal their decision, doing so may make your appeal more likely to be rejected. Moderators and administrators will review the case and any relevant context to determine whether the action was appropriate.
    - Appeals must be respectful and constructive. Personal attacks against moderators or dismissive responses may result in further penalties. If your appeal is denied, the decision will stand, and continued attempts to bypass or contest it could lead to further sanctions.
7. Moderator Discretion
    - Moderators may apply sanctions based on context. Not every violation fits neatly into a specific category, and moderators may use their discretion when issuing warnings or sanctions. The intent behind the action, its impact on the community, and the user’s behavior history will be considered.
8. Zero Tolerance for Retaliation
    - Retaliating against members for reporting misconduct is prohibited. If you report a violation or inappropriate behavior, you are protected from any form of retaliation. Attempts to harass or intimidate members who report others will result in immediate disciplinary action.
